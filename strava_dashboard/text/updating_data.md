The data displayed are periodically updated by manually running `R/scrape_strava.qmd`, which cleans and saves the newly acquired data to `strava_dashboard/data/`. The application reads in data from this subdirectory. A mid-term / future (and currently in-progress) goal is to automate this process using AWS S3 Buckets for data storage and GitHub Actions for data retrieval and application redeployment.
