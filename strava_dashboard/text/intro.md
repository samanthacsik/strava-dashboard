Hi there! My name is Sam Csik (pronounced "Chick"), and if you've found your way to this app through my [personal website](https://samanthacsik.github.io/), you probably already know that I seriously enjoy a good hike. I started recording my activities on [Strava](https://www.strava.com/) in early 2020, and have been politely declined each notification to try out the Premium version ever since. 

After fiddling around a bit with the Strava API, the `{rstrava}` package, and some helpful articles by fellow Stava-ers, I pulled my data and created my first `leaflet` map in a long while. Now, with a goal of becoming a bit more proficient at building Shiny apps and dashboards, I'm returning with my data in an attempt to recreate some of Strava Premium's best visualizations. 


<p>Data displayed are updated periodically by running `R/scrape_strava.R` script by hand (though a future goal is to automate this process!), then saving the newly acquired data to `strava_dashboard/data/`.</p>
