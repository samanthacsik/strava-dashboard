**Hi there! My name is Sam Csik (pronounced "Chick")**, and if you've found your way to this app through my [personal website](https://samanthacsik.github.io/), you probably already know that I seriously enjoy a good hike. 

I started recording my activities on [Strava](https://www.strava.com/) in early 2020, and have politely declined each notification to try out the Premium version ever since (despite always being jealous of some of the awesome Premium features -- particularly the heatmaps!).

After fiddling around a bit with the Strava API, the `{rStrava}` package, and some helpful articles by fellow Stava-ers, I pulled my data and created my own activity heatmap using `leaflet`, which I've been proudly displaying on my website's [about page](https://samanthacsik.github.io/about.html) ever since. Now, with a goal of becoming a bit more proficient at building Shiny apps and dashboards, I'm returning with my data in an attempt to both enhance existing and create new fun and interactive visualizations.
