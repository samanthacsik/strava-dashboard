This Strava heatmap was built using [`leaflet`](https://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/) and with the help of the [`{googleway}`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/googleway/index.html) package for decoding polylines. Explore all recorded activities by moving around the map and hovering over trailhead/activity icons. Toggle icons on and off using the layers control in the top right corner. To learn how to create your own Strava heatmap in R, head to the **Tutorials** tab!
